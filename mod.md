Clock Widget Refactor – For All Clock Files (*.dart)
Prompt-style checklist (apply this to every clock file):

python
Copy
Edit
🔁 Replace any hardcoded color, font, size with values from `ClockSettings`.

🧱 Wrap all layout sizes with MediaQuery or LayoutBuilder to make clocks responsive.

🎯 Add RepaintBoundary around any CustomPainter or Animation-heavy widget.

📦 Accept ClockSettings via constructor like:
    class FadingClock extends StatelessWidget {
      final ClockSettings settings;
      ...
    }

🎨 Apply settings like:
    TextStyle(
      fontSize: settings.fontSize,
      fontFamily: settings.fontFamily,
      color: settings.fontColor,
    )

🧠 Replace any Timer inside build with initState-based logic to avoid memory leaks.

💤 Use TickerMode to pause animations if clock is not visible (future: swipe carousel).

🧪 Add a debug mode toggle in ClockSettings (e.g., show frame stats).
✅ 📱 UI/UX Enhancements

Copy

🧭 Add a bottom nav bar or tab switcher for:
    - Clock View
    - Customize
    - About

🎨 Add a preview in Customize screen showing live clock with current settings.

🔤 Load fonts dynamically using `google_fonts` package.

📸 Add support for background images (file picker or asset).

📁 Use SharedPreferences to save settings across app launches.

🌙 Add dark/light theme toggle or auto-switch by system brightness.

🕓 Add 12/24h toggle.

🔄 Add a “Clock Auto Switcher” feature (rotate clock styles every 30 sec).
✅ 🛠 Codebase & Architecture Upgrades
javascript
Copy
Edit
📦 Use Provider for global state management (done ✅).

🔑 Modularize clock widgets under `lib/clocks/` folder.

⚙️ Add `pubspec.yaml` dependencies:
    flutter_colorpicker
    provider
    shared_preferences
    google_fonts

🧼 Remove unused imports, comments, and legacy sensor code.

💥 Setup launcher icon via `flutter_launcher_icons`.

💧 Add splash screen using `flutter_native_splash`.

📄 Add a license file and terms screen (basic T&C page).
✅ 🌟 Optional (Nice-to-Have Features)

🎥 Add a clock showcase mode that cycles styles automatically with fade effect.

🧭 Add swipe left/right to switch clocks on clock screen.

🗣 Add text-to-speech time announcer (every X minutes).

📤 Add “Export Screenshot” button to share the current clock screen.

🌐 Localize time/date format for multiple languages (intl package).
🚀 Final Suggestion Prompt (for yourself or ChatGPT)
“I want to refactor all my Flutter clock widgets to use ClockSettings for font, color, and size. Also make them responsive, performance-optimized, and able to render based on dynamic settings.”

“Build a Customize screen in Flutter with dropdowns for font, sliders for size, and color pickers for font and background. All changes should reflect in real-time.”

[ ] Have you implemented the battery-saving timer logic in all clock files?



[ ] Have you added const to all static widgets for better performance?



[ ] (Optional but Recommended) Have you added a settings screen?
